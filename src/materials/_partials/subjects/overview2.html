  <h2>Physics drives technology
  </h2>
  <p>Physics is the problem-solving engine behind the new tech industries that are reinventing New Zealand’s economy.
    Learn to create theoretical models that fuel real innovation. You’ll develop the skills to help to create cutting edge technologies like next-generation solar panels, or to model climate change more accurately than ever before.  </p>

        <h2>The mechanics of the universe </h2>
      <p>When you study Physics at Te Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellington, you’ll discover the components and forces that make up our universe. You’ll be learning from world-leading specialists in exciting new areas like biophysics, astrophysics, and spintronics—visiting their laboratories and participating in their research.
      </p>
      <p>Learn about orbital mechanics and develop an understanding of how objects move around the galaxy. Explore electromagnetism, the science behind radio-based technologies as diverse as mobile phones, microwaves, and medical scanners. Discover thermal physics, and build an understanding of the theoretical framework behind climate change.
      </p>
      <p> Finally, you’ll delve into quantum mechanics and learn to create models of the smallest processes in the universe, those between atoms and molecules—models that can, in turn, help us to better understand tiny entities like coronaviruses.  </p>

    <h2>Wellington—New Zealand’s technology hub
    </h2>
    <p>You’ll build connections for your future through the University’s relationships with Wellington’s technology and innovation community.
    </p>
    <p>You’ll have the opportunity to learn from and work with leading researchers at institutes like NIWA and the Robinson and MacDiarmid research institutes, as well as forging relationships with the city’s start-ups and growing tech industry.

    <h2>Physics is collaborative   </h2>
    <p>Modern physics is all about working as a team—and our approach to teaching reflects this. You’ll get close support from teaching staff and other students throughout your study. Physics at Wellington has a whānau approach where it’s safe to make mistakes as you’re learning, where you know the staff and the staff know you.
    </p>
    <p>We’re housed in a bright and open building, with plenty of common spaces where you can learn collaboratively. </p>
